# Player training, ranking and boosting

## Training
This is a process of increasing the values of the player item’s attributes via training experience points (TXP). You can generally also consume other player items since each player item contains TXP. Some player items use special TXP for their training and these players cannot be consumed to train other player items.

Training a player item increases its training level. With each training level, a small number of player item’s attributes will be improved.

Before you train a player item, you can tap on ‘upgrade preview ’to view the attributes that will be affected by increasing the training level of the player item by 1.

After selecting items, you want to use to train the player, you will see the cost of training on the ‘train’ button. You can choose to train a player item to more than one level at once. When using other player items as TXP beware that:

* Using players for TXP will discard the used items from your inventory
* You can only use forwards to train forwards, midfielders to train midfielders, backfield players to train backfield players, and goalkeepers to train goalkeepers
* Player items in your Starting 11 and on your substitute list, players items that have been trained, and player items that have been ranked up, will not show on the list of available player items to use
* Player items that have been locked, will require you to unlock them first before you use them.
  
```{note}
* At the end of every 5 training levels, you are required to rank the item
* Regardless of OVR, training and /or upgrading player items from and to the same training level, will cost the same. For example, training an 80 OVR player item from level 0 to level 5 will cost the same amount of coins as training a 93 OVR level player item from 0 to level 5.
```
## Ranking
This is a process of increasing the values of the player item’s attributes via rank items. Training a player item increases its training overall rating (OVR) and rank-up level. With each rank level, many player item’s attributes will be improved.

You will see the cost of ranking up a player item on the ‘rank up’ button

```{note}
* For every 5 Training levels, you can rank-up your player item
* Rank items will be consumed even if the rank up fails
* Goalkeepers require GK rank items, midfielders require MID rank items, forwards require FWD rank items, and backfield players require DEF rank items
```

Before you rank up a player item, you can tap on the information icon on the top-right of ‘player attributes increase’, to preview the attributes that will be affected by increasing the rank-up level of the player item by 1. You can scroll up to see the full list

Regardless of OVR, training and /or upgrading player items from and to the same training level, will cost the same. For example, training an 82 OVR player item from level 10 to level 25(ranking it from 82 OVR to 85 OVR), will cost the same amount of coins as training a 94 OVR level player item from 10 to level 25 (ranking it from 94 OVR to 97 OVR),

## Boosting
This is a process of increasing the values of the player item’s attributes via skill boost items

Having collected required skill boost’s duplicates, it costs coins to upgrade the skill boost’s level. This boost will be applied to all the associated player items in your inventory. After upgrading the skill boost, you will immediately see the boost bonus and how much the relevant attributes have been boosted.

## Training and Rank level transfer
This is the process of transferring the rank level and training level from one player item to another.

Besides the cost of the transfer, all that is required is that the player item to which the transfer is made should be at least 1 rank level below the player item from which the transfer is made.

As soon as the transfer is complete, you can view the recipient item’s attributes that have been improved and by how much.
