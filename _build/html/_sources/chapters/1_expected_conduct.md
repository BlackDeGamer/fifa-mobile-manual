## Rules

There are a few specific rules that Electronic Arts (EA) wants you to know about, so you and other players have the best experience possible. These rules are to keep things fun and fair for everyone that plays FIFA Mobile.

### Do not cheat in-game
In-game cheating is not fair play and hurts the experience for the players you are playing against.Cheating can include but is not limited to, using external tools, performing in-game exploits, and abusing glitches or bugs.

For example, if you work with other players or accounts to increase your rank, it is cheating. It creates an unfair advantage on the field. Do not do it.

### Do not hack other players’ accounts
Accessing another player’s account is totally and completely against the rules.

### Do not buy Coins
You can earn FIFA Mobile coins by playing, buying, and selling items in the market, but buying coins from a third party is against the rules.

A few ways to earn FIFA Mobile coins legitimately are:
* Playing live events
* Completing daily activities
* Buying and selling players and other items on the market

Buying coins creates an unlevel playing field. It affects the player economy when the prices of items in the Market increase and become unaffordable. When coin buyers buy cheap items in the market, they take away the opportunity to buy affordable items from players who earned their coins legitimately.

If you buy coins, you are at risk of having your account information stolen by phishers. Coin sellers need account login information to give out coins, so that means they can just as easily remove items from your account, too. They can also turn around and make a profit from the items they steal and hack someone else. Help keep your account safe and do not give your login information to anyone.

Buying “mule” accounts or performing comfort trades are also not allowed. These things are against EA’s gameplay rules because they harm the game economy, and they damage gameplay for you and other players. Do not do it.

### Do not farm Coins
You can earn coins in a bunch of different ways in FIFA Mobile. But farming coins is a big no-no.

Coin farming is when you get coins fast and illegitimately, either by using bots in the market or by tricking the game into thinking you are playing matches when you are not.

When you store a lot of coins on your account, that is cool if you are earning those coins the right way in-game. If you use any sort of bot or disconnection methods in-game so you can earn coins fast and illegitimately, that is breaking the rules.

### Do not distribute or sell coins
Coin selling and distribution hurts the FIFA Mobile economy. That means disrupting the safe buying and selling environment that legitimate players are trying to use to get the players they need for their team.

### Do not buy FIFA Points from a third-party seller
There are only two ways to get FIFA Points: Buying them in-game and earning them when you complete some activities in the game.

Like buying coins from a third party, you are risking having your account information stolen by phishers. These sellers need your account login information to get the points and you are risking them hacking you or someone else in the process.

### Do not abuse or use bots in the Market
Using bots or exploiting the market in any way gives an unfair advantage and hurts the experience for you and other players. It can also negatively affect the affordability of certain items that are for sale in the market, making it harder for legitimate players to enjoy the game they know and love.

### Do not make false claims
Making a false claim to EA Help Advisors or any other EA representative is against the gameplay rules, and it’s not cool. Breaking the rules makes it hard to offer a fun, safe, and secure environment for you and all players.

## What happens if you break the rules?

If you break the rules, EA might:

* Reset your Fans.
* Suspend your account or permanently ban it in serious cases.
* Restrict your access in other ways.
