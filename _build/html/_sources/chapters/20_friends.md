# Friends

You can add up to 32 friends or foes to your friends' list and keep track of your wins, draws, and losses. You can see each friend’s status as Online (green), Offline (grey), or in a match (red).

## Sorting friends' list
There are a few ways you can sort your friends' list:

* **Login Status**: this lists your friends by beginning with those that are online and available to play, then those that are online and still in a match, and finally those that are offline.
* **Alphabetically**: Using the beginning letter(s) of their usernames, this lists your friends in the order of the letters of the alphabet.
* **Overall rating(OVR)**: This lists your friends by beginning with those whose active line-up has the highest overall rating and ending with those whose active line-up has the least.
* **Head-to-head ranking**: This lists your friends by beginning with those with the highest number of cups and ending with those with the least number of cups.
* **VS attack ranking**: This lists your friends by beginning with those with the highest number of fans and ending with those with the least number of fans.
* **Account-level**: This lists your friends by beginning with those with the highest account level and ending with those with the least account level.

## Friend options

In the “friends” menu there’s a lot you can do, from playing with friends, inviting them to your league to looking at both your history.

* **Match**: When your friend is online, this feature is enabled, and you can send them a match request. When your friend is offline, this option is disabled.When you sent a match request to a friend, they will be notified, and the request will appear in their inbox where they can choose to accept or decline your request.
* **Profile**: This feature enables you to see your friend's profile
* **History**: Up to 5 previous matches, this feature enables you to see how you fared against your friend. For each type of match, the record shows the number of times you won, drew, and lost against your friend.
* **League invite**: If you are in a league and you are an administrator or the league’s owner, this feature enables you to invite your friend to your league.
* **Unfriend**: This feature enables you to remove the gamer from your friends' list

## Add friend
To have someone on your friends' list, one of you should send a friend request and the other should accept it. There are several ways you can send a friend request to another gamer.

* **Recommended friends**:
From the ‘friends’ menu, selecting “add friends” will take you to a list of recommended friends where you can “add friend”. The game makes these recommendations based on similarities between your account and theirs. This can include account data such as account level, account region, and active line-up’s overall rating

* **Search**:
Having selected ‘add friends’, looking at the recommended list and still preferring to search for a friend by username, then tap “search”. There you can type your preferred username and search for a friend.

* **Match history**:
From either your or anyone else’s match history, you can send a friend request to any gamer on the list.

* **Members' list of a league**:
Within your or any league, you can send a friend request to any of the members.
