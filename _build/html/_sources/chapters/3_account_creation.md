# Account creation

After successfully downloading the FIFA Mobile app and launching it, you will need to create an account before proceeding into the game.

## Regions

When creating an account, your account will ultimately be assigned to one of the 7 regions.

* Asia & Oceania
* Europe, East
* Europe, West
* Indian Subcontinent
* Latin America
* Middle East & Africa
* North America

The assignment is based on your device’s location (IP address). The full list of countries assigned to each region can be found here. Once your account has been assigned to a region, your region assignment cannot be changed.

The following are all the aspects that will be affected by the region segmentation:

* Matchmaking in all modes (VS Attack, Head-to-head): you are only matched with gamers from your region
* Leader boards (Division Rivals, Live Events): the rankings include only gamers in your region
* Leagues: You can only join or create leagues for your region
* Friend Lists: you can only send and/or receive friend requests to/ from gamers in your region

## Creating an account

The game requires you to input your age and a username to create your account. 

```{note}
* Once you have chosen the username (maximum 16 characters), you cannot change it later. FIFA Mobile currently has no functionality for a user to change their username.

* Once you have selected your age, you cannot change it, later. Accounts of certain ages have limited access to some game features.
Experience levels
```
## Experience levels

Your account's experience level is 0 when you begin a FIFA Mobile season. You can increase your account level from 0 by accumulating experience points. Completing certain matches in the game awards experience points.

Some game features are locked in lower experience levels. Reaching certain account levels unlocks some of the locked game features. such as Chemistry, formations, and line-ups.For example:

* Reaching account level 2 will see you unlock 9 formations. Thereafter, 1 formation will be unlocked for every 2 account levels achieved until all 29 formations have been unlocked
* Reaching account level 10 will unlock the “League” feature. You can create or join a league
* Reaching account level 15 will enable a purchase of extra line-ups from the game’s store
Saving gaming progress

## Save account progress
To save your account progress, you need to link FIFA Mobile to one of the following accounts:

* Game Centre (iOS)
* Google Play (Android)
* Facebook (iOS & Android)
* Apple Account (iOS)

Linking FIFA Mobile to any of the accounts above gives you the ability to play FIFA Mobile using multiple devices without losing your account progress. Your progress can be recovered after you reset your phone to factory settings or update its OS or delete the FIFA Mobile app or are using a new mobile device.

**Linking your FIFA Mobile account**

To link an account:

* Open FIFA Mobile
* Go to the Settings menu
* Under “Setting”, choose “Link Accounts”
* Click ‘Link’ next to the option you want to link (like Facebook, Game Centre, or Google Play)

The most recent update about linking your account can be found here.

**Not linking your FIFA Mobile account**

Without linking to an account, you will play as a guest. Guests can only save account progress directly to a mobile device the game is being played on.

Playing as a guest has a few drawbacks:

* You can only play your game on the device you downloaded and have an account on. Your game will not move over to different devices
* All game progress will be lost if you factory-reset your device, install a major OS update, or delete the app
* Lost game progress is permanent. Electronic Arts cannot recover an unsaved game-progress
