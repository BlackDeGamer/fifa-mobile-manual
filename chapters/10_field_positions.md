# Field positions

## Goalkeeper (GK)
A goalkeeper is the most defensive position in football. Their job is mainly defensive: to guard the team’s goalpost against breaches by the ball (to not let the other team score). Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands and arms, however, they are restricted to doing so only within the 18-yard box; for this reason, they must wear jerseys that distinguish them from other outfield players and the referee.

## Left/Right Back (LB, RB)
Right-backs and left-backs are the defenders stationed on either side of the centre-backs to protect from attacks. They often must defend against the opponent’s wingers, who will try to take the ball past them down the flanks to cross or pass to their attackers. They also take thrown-ins and provide support for the wide midfield ahead of them, eventually overlapping and sending crosses into the opposition box.

## Left/Right Wing-Back (LWB, RWB)
Right and left wingbacks are modern variations of fullbacks. They are defenders who can also attack. They are expected to stay on their touchline, overlap and send crosses into the opposition box but still mark opposition wingers when needed. It is one of the most physically demanding positions in modern football.

## Centre Back (CB)
Centre-backs play in a central position of the defence. Their job is to stop opposing players, particularly the strikers, from scoring and bring the ball out from their penalty area. CBs are often tall, strong and have good jumping, heading, and tackling abilities. Successful centre-backs also need to be able to concentrate, read the game well and be brave and decisive in making last-ditch tackles on attacking players who might otherwise be through on goal.

## Central Defensive Midfielder (CDM)
Defensive midfielders are stationed in front of the defenders to provide a more secure defence, thus “holding back” the freedom of the opponents to attack. The CDM screens the defence by harrying and tackling the opposition teams’ attackers and defenders. They also help tactically, for instance, by directing central attacking players out to the wing where they have more limited influence and by covering the positions of full-backs, midfielders and even the centre-backs as they charge up into the attack.

## Central Midfielder (CM)
Central midfielders play several roles on the field of play, depending on their strengths and the tactics of the team. They are the link between defence and attack and must also defend when the opposition is in possession. Their central position enables them to have an all-around view of the match, and as most of the action takes place in and around their area of the pitch, midfielders often exert the greatest degree of control over how a match is played.

## Central Attacking Midfielder (CAM)
Attacking midfielders are positioned in an advanced midfield position, usually between central midfield and the team’s forwards. Their main role is to create goal-scoring opportunities using superior vision and skill. The attacking midfielder is an important position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and, perhaps more importantly, the ability to read the opposing defence to deliver defence-splitting passes to the strikers.

## Left/Right Midfielder (LM, RM)
Right and left midfielders are stationed in a wide position effectively hugging the touchline. Like all attacking players, wide midfielders need to have ‘off-the-ball’ intelligence, by being able to read passes from the midfield that give them a clear crossing or scoring opportunity. Usually, right-footed players are played on the right flank and left-footed players on the left as a matter of familiarity and comfort.

## Left/Right Winger (LW, RW)
Right and left-wingers are stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. A winger’s main attribute is usually speed, which is used to attack and dribble past the opponent’s fullbacks to get behind the defence and to then deliver crosses and passes into the centre for their attackers. Occasionally they may swap sides of the field as a tactical move.

## Left/Right Forward (LF, RF)
Right and left forwards play along the wing. This position is like a winger position but a wide-forward plays on the front line and emphasises more on beating defenders than crossing the ball. Wingers and wide forwards share many similarities such as needing crossing, dribbling and pace. This is the rarest position in FIFA Mobile (only shows up on the 3-4-2-1 formation).

## Centre Forward (CF)
Centre-forwards are positioned between midfield and attack. They have two roles: first, they score goals through passes from teammates; second, they distract the defence to give room for the attacking midfielder, winger or withdrawn striker to attack. They usually need a good vision, technical and creative skills.

## Striker (ST)
Strikers are positioned nearest to the opposing team’s goal. Their primary responsibility is to score goals and to create scoring chances for other players. They can also hold the ball up until teammates can join the attack and harry opposition defenders and goalkeepers whilst not in possession. A striker must be brilliant at receiving and controlling the ball, strong and capable of winning the ball in the air.
