# Chemistry

This is the system in the game that allows you to gain the advantage during your matches (both in head-to-head and vs-attack) by using player items with similar biographical information.

Before the chemistry feature is unlocked, your line-up will not show any links between the players in their formation. When the chemistry feature has been unlocked, the player items on your line-up will be linked to each other based on their position on the formation.

## Chemistry points
Linked players (each with at least an 80 overall rating) that belong to the same league or club or nation or program or have wild card chemistry grant chemistry points to each other.

A player with wildcard chemistry (denoted by a joker symbol in his biography) will grant chemistry points (where wildcard chemistry is applied) to any other player item.

The number on the right shows how many chemistry-points the player items can potentially give to a linked player.

## Team chemistry

Rugani’s player item can neither display nor receive nor give chemistry points because it has less than 80 overall rating

Numbers on the right show how many chemistry points, the player item can give to a linked player if they belong to either the same club, league, and/or nation.

Numbers on the left show how many chemistry-points, the player item is receiving from a linked player.

The number in the form “a/b” at the bottom of the player item shows the chemistry points received (a) versus the chemistry points capacity (b) of the player item.

The sum of all the chemistry points received by your player items contributes towards your line-up’s chemistry rating. The higher your team’s chemistry rating the better your team will perform in vs-attack and head-to-head.

## Chemistry link-types

There are 4 types of links:
* **Broken link** (grey dashed line): This is a link between player items where at least one of them has an OVR less than 80. E.g., Rugani and Stones
* **Grey link** (grey solid line): This is a link between 80+ OVR player items that do not give each other any chemistry points. They do not have any common biographical information. E.g., Foden and Bale
* **Green link** (green solid line): This is a link between 80+ OVR player items that have at least one of the club, league, program, and nation in common. E.g., Stones and Alexander-Arnold
* **Perfect link** (bright green solid line): This is a link between 80+ OVR player items that have at least one of the club, league, program, and nation in common with each other, and share at least 75% of chemistry points they can give, with each other. E.g., Stones and Alli

## Maximun chemistry

This is the number of chemistry points that can be included in your chemistry rating.
As your account level increases, you will also unlock a higher threshold of maximum chemistry. The maximum chemistry rating in the game is 100 and will be unlocked once you achieve account level 30.
In the screenshot above, the sum of the chemistry points shared in the line-up is 81 but the current account level only allows 50 chemistry points to be included in the chemistry rating. Thus, this line-up has a chemistry rating of 50.
If the squad is kept the same and the account level increased until the next chemistry threshold is unlocked, then the chemistry rating will increase.
