# Players

This section shows all the inventory of players you have. Any player item in any of your line-ups will have a shirt icon on it. You can lock player items to avoid mistakenly selling them or using them to train other player items. Any locked item will have a padlock icon on it.

**Sorting items**

This feature allows you to arrange your inventory based on a player item’s OVR, field position, whether it’s locked or whether it is included in any of your line-ups.

* **OVR** - This will arrange the player items in descending order beginning with an item with the highest
* **Position** - This will arrange the player items by beginning with those assigned positions (from left to right) at the pitch front and ending with those assigned positions at the pitch end.
* **Locked** - This will arrange the player items by beginning with those that are locked and ending with those that aren’t.
* **In line-up**- This will arrange the player items by beginning with those that are included in any of your line-ups locked and ending with those that aren’t.
