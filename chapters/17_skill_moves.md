# Skill moves

Skill moves is a feature that lets you assign different team skill moves (dribbling moves) to different swipe directions, of the ‘sprint & skill’ button. Performing the swipe actions will enable eligible player items to perform the dribbling moves during the match.

**Types of skill moves**
There are two types of skill moves:
* Player skill moves
* Team skill moves

## Team skill move

This is a skill move that can be assigned to any of the swipe directions of the ‘sprint & skill’ button. By swiping on the “sprint & skill” button, it can then be performed by eligible player items in your matches.
Team skill moves rating: this is a 1-to-5-star rating that depicts the difficulty of the skill move. This rating is also an indicator of the minimum ‘player skill moves rating’ required for a player to be eligible to perform the skill move.

Locked and unlocked team skill moves Some team skill moves are unlocked while some are locked. Those that are locked require you to purchase them from the game’s store before you can assign them to your team.

## Player skill move

This is the player item’s assigned skill move which they can perform by default or by tapping the “sprint & skill” button.

Player skill moves rating: This is the 1-to-5-star rating of the team skill moves the player can perform. For example, a 4-star skill player can only perform 1 to 4-star team skill moves, but not 5-star team skill moves. All players will still have a regular tap skill move that is assigned to them as part of their traits.

You can choose the skill moves you want for left-, right-, up-, and down- swipes. You can also enable/disable some or all swipe skill moves

## Assigning team skill moves

You can assign, at most, 4 skill moves. There are 4 slots, and they correspond to the 4 swipe directions on the “sprint & skill” button. On each slot you will see:

* The name of the skill moves
* The skill move’s rating
* The number of player items, in your active line-up, that are or can be (depending on whether the slot is enabled or disabled) assigned this skill move
* The swipe direction the skill move has been assigned on the “sprint & skill” button
  
To change the team skill move assigned to the slot, tap on the slot, and tap “change”.

You will have options to assign an unassigned team skill move or reassign/exchange a team skill move from its assigned slot. You can play the short video to see how the skill move is performed by a player against an opponent.

When you assign an unassigned team skill move, the current team skill move will be unassigned and can later be assigned to a different slot. When you exchange the assigned team skill moves, the team skill moves will be assigned to each other’s slot.

Assigned team skill moves can be seen by the slot number (1 to 4) they have been assigned to. Filtering If you don’t want to scroll through all the team skill moves, you can filter them by their rating. In the example below we have filtered by 3-stars rated team skill moves.

Viewing eligible player items Before or after assigning or exchanging team skill moves, you can see which of your players, in the current line-up, are eligible to use the selected team skill move.

In this case, the ‘Roulette’ skill move can only be performed by 9 players in the current line-up.

If you have more than 1 line-up, you can also use the filter on the bottom right, to see which players are eligible to use the selected team skill move in your different line-ups.

(I have only 1 line-up named “my team”, so the filter in the image below has one entry)

## Consecutive Skill Move Error
Using back-to-back skill moves won’t only cost your player a lot of stamina. If you chain multiple skill moves, it will affect the player’s dribbling error and dribbling speed. This means that there is a progressively greater chance of losing the ball after consecutive skill moves. This affects all skill moves, regardless of order or type.

Passing to a teammate or waiting a few seconds resets your player’s dribbling error level. The reason for this change is to encourage more variety in attacking play and discourage players from continually performing skill moves during the match.

When performing a skill move in general, the agility stat affects the speed of the skill move while the ball control stat determines the potential error rating.
