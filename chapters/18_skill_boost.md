# Skill boosts

Here you see all the skill boosts. For each, you will see:

* The number of player items in your active line-up that are associated with that skill boost
* The number of duplicates you have collected for that skill boost
* The level the skill boost has been upgraded to
* The number of duplicates required to upgrade the skill boost to the next level.

## Sorting skill boosts

This feature allows you to arrange the skill boosts based on:

* **OVR impact** - It will sort your skill boosts, in descending order, by beginning with the skill boosts that will have an impact on your active line-upâ€™s overall rating when levelled up
* **Level** - This will sort your skill boosts, in descending order, by beginning with skill boosts that have been levelled up the highest
* **Players affected** - This will sort your skill boosts, in descending order, by beginning with the skill boost that affects most player items in your current line-up
