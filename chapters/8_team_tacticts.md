# Team tactics

## Head-to-head tactics

* **Attacking**: Will move up the position of your Defensive Line, trigger more Attacking Runs from your teammates and push up the GK during Corner Kicks in the last 5 mins of the match.

* **Balanced**: This is the default setting which has the default Defensive Line position and moderate amount of Attacking Runs by teammates.

* **Defensive**: Will move back the position of your Defensive Line and heavily restrict teammates from going on Attacking Runs

## Manager mode tactics
**Control**

* **Build up speed**: Determines the speed and urgency that players will have when moving the ball into the attacking third. Higher speed means prioritising faster passing. Lower speed means players will try to retain possession more.
* **Passing distance**: The tendency of short to long distance passes that players will perform.
* **Mentality**: Controls the rate at which your players make runs up and down the field (Defending, Balanced, Attacking)
* **Positioning**
  * **Organised**: Players will stick to their exact position in a strict manner.
  * **Free**: Players will often roam into other areas of the pitch depending on game situation.

**Offence**

* **Passing rate**: Determines the frequency of your players passing the ball. Choosing a higher Passing Rate means your players will attempt more through passes and riskier passes. Lower Passing Rate means your players will opt for safer and less contested passes throughout the pitch.
* **Cross rate**: Determines the frequency of your players moving the ball towards the wings and crossing into the box.
* **Shooting rate**: Determines the frequency of your players taking a shot. Choosing a higher Shooting Rate means your players will attempt to shoot more often, even from distance. Lower Shooting Rate means your players will be more conservative with their shots and will not shoot until they are closer to the net.
* **Positioning**
    * **Organised**: Attacking players will stick to their exact position in a strict manner. This means that your wingers will not drift inside and your strikers will not drift outside or fall back into midfield.
    * **Free**: Attacking players will often roam into other areas of the pitch depending on game situation. This means that wingers may drift inside to support your strikers, and your strikers may drift to the wings or into the midfield.

**Defence**

* **Pressure**: The rate at which a Second Defender Press will be triggered and how tight your defenders will mark attackers. Higher Pressure means your players will mark opponents more aggressively, often pulling a second defender in to help. Lower Pressure means your players will mark opponents more conservatively, with fewer second defenders coming in for support.
* **Width**:
  * **Narrow**: This adjusts your defensive shape to be narrow to have more players in the middle of the pitch for defensive coverage. This means that the centre of the pitch will have more defensive focus, while the wings will be more open.
  * **Balanced**: This adjusts your defensive shape to be balanced for generic positioning.
  * **Wide**: This adjusts your defensive shape to cover your wide players (left/right backs and left/right midfielders) towards the sidelines. This means that the wings will have more defensive focus, while the centre of the pitch will be more open.
* **Tackle tendency**: Determines the frequency at which your players will commit to a tackle, or if they will contain the attacker.

* **Positioning**
  * **Free**: Your defenders will not attempt the Offside Trap.
  * **Offside trap**: This tactic tells your defenders to quickly push up as a unit, with the goal of catching an attacker offside.

**Presets**
* **Attacking**: The Attacking Tactic will push your team into aggressive attacking positions. Your players will move further up the field with the intent of scoring quickly. Your players will look for direct passes into dangerous positions. You may be susceptible to your midfielders being out of position during a change of possession, along with a high risk of being countered, so use this tactic wisely.
  
* **Control**: The Control Tactic is focused on maintaining possession and methodically moving up the pitch. Your players will make shorter passes and avoid riskier passes. Your players will look for the best situation to break past the defence, but they will not force passes. This Tactic is best suited for teams with technical players who can break down a defence patiently.
  
* **Counter**: The Counter Tactic is about sitting deep and striking quickly on the counterattack. Once you regain possession, your players will make long through balls into space for your attackers to run onto. The ball will move quickly through your midfielder with the goal of catching your opponent out of position. This Tactic is best suited for teams with pacey attackers upfront and athletic midfielders.
  
* **Defensive**: The Defensive Tactic is all about being organised and disciplined at the back with the goal of preventing attacking chances. Your players will drop back and crowd the defensive third of the pitch to clog up opportunities for your opponent. When you recover possession, your players will look to make long passes up to your attackers to relieve pressure. Additionally, this Tactic will keep attacking runs to a minimum in order to keep your formation’s shape. This Tactic is best suited for teams who are outmatched or looking to hold on to lead.
  
* **Custom**: The Custom Tactic is all up to you! You can slightly tweak the existing Tactics or completely overhaul it to fit your team’s needs. There are tons of different possibilities for you to explore and master. Create your Custom Tactic and save it before entering a match, or create a different one in the middle of a match, the choice is yours!
