# Game modes

## VS Attack (VSA)
This is a quick and simple 90-second match where you compete against an opponent. Each participant is given various grades of chances in quick succession, with the goal being that participants attempt to out-score one another in the allotted 90 seconds.

The clock never stops for free kicks, out of bounds, or penalty kicks. So, your best strategy is to play smart, be efficient, score as quickly as possible, and run as many attacks as you can before time runs out.

## Head-to-head (H2H)

This is a match where you attempt to outscore your opponent by participating in a full 11-vs-11 game with two-minute halves against your opponent. It’s like VS Attack, but it uses cups for matchmaking instead of fans and you cannot reconnect to a match if the app crashes or you lose connection.

By default, the skill game picks a player based on their position on your active line-up’s formation.
